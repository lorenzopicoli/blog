Hi, I'm Lorenzo! I'm currently working as a tech lead at [MaintainX](https://www.getmaintainx.com/), where we build maintenance and work execution software.

Before that, I spent five years (2019-2024) at [Commutifi](https://www.commutifi.com/) as one of their first developers. I did a bit of everything over those 5 years – from implementing route scoring algorithms to building data warehouse pipeline, and yes, I may have accidentally dropped the production database once.

My journey in software development started in the iOS ecosystem, which still holds a place close to my heart. It helped me land my first few gigs and enabled me to buy my beloved iMac 2009. This eventually led to my first professional role at [PicPay](https://picpay.com/), which later became Brazil's second-largest digital banking platform. From 2018 to 2019, I worked at [Volume7](https://www.volume7.io/), a Montreal-based agency, further expanding my development expertise.

# My Other Projects

I'm a data enthusiast for as long as I can remember. In an age where companies collect ridiculous amounts of user data, I decided that since they'll have my data, I might as well also collect data on myself. Peek into my phone today and you'll find [Owntracks](https://owntracks.org/) tracking every place I visit, while all my devices connect back to my home network through [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) so I can log every DNS query in [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)

Over the years, I've open-sourced significant portions of my setup, including my complete [infrastructure configuration](https://github.com/lorenzopicoli/selfhosted), which I maintain using Ansible. For my notes and overall organization I use the wonderful [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

# This Website

This website is built from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Rather than using a pre-built theme, I created a custom design. You can explore the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/lorenzopicoli/blog).
