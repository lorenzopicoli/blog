This project holds all the code necessary to fully replicate my homelab setup from scratch. It contains all the Ansible playbooks required to configure hosts and services from nothing.

This project doesn't live on a website, but it's an ongoing effort to allow anyone (including myself) to replicate my homelab setup by spinning up all necessary host machines and containers.

To find out more about this project, take a look at my [2024 end-of-the-year recap](/posts/2024-selfhosted-recap/).
