During the peak of the [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) phenomenon, I was inspired to test my iOS development skills by creating a simple yet addictive game. FlatFill was incredibly fun to develop, and although it didn't achieve the same success as [Flash Study](projects/flash-study/), it introduced me to the world of iOS game development.
