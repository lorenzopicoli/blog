Wealthsimple is an investment/banking company used in North America, and I use it for many of my financial transactions. One of its major limitations is the lack of export options. To address this, I built this browser extension (supporting Google Chrome and Firefox) that automatically exports your transactions to CSV with a single click.

This project is currently active and I use it monthly as part of my [PTA](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) approach to keeping track of my finances.
