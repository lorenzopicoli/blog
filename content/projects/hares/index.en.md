Hares is not like other habit trackers. It’s unapologetically simple and doesn’t care _what_ you track — it will track anything you throw at it.

When it comes to logging habits, there are a few things I’ve come to believe are non-negotiable:

- **It needs to be fast.** I need to be able to log things on the go—on days when I’m too happy to bother or too depressed to get out of bed. No questions, no surveys, just logging.
- **It needs to be flexible.** If I start a new exercise at the gym, I need to be able to create a new tracker instantly. Some things—like mood or food—can’t be fully defined ahead of time. They have nuances I want to capture even if I didn’t think about them a month earlier. “Down” is different from “meh,” and I need to log both.
- **It needs to be welcoming of change.** I’ve changed how I track my coffee and caffeine intake multiple times depending on the period of my life, how important it is to me, or what I’ve learned about self-tracking. Tweaking my habit trackers shouldn’t be scary.

Hares is my answer to all of that. It lives by those rules, and it was built for _me_.

It runs on Android, has automatic backups and notifications, and is my daily driver for gym tracking, meal tracking, mood tracking, and any other obsession of the week.
