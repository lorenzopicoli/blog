Where was I exactly one year ago? How much did I fly in the last 5 years? How many times have I woken up to see fresh snow outside? How does the weather impact the genre of music that I listen to? How many cities have I visited?

The goal of Lomnia is to answer all of those questions and more. I've found that I have all the tools to track my every step through a combination of gadgets (smart watches), self-hosted software (Owntracks and others), and APIs (Spotify, weather, etc.). By processing and aggregating all that data in a single database, I should be able to create a dashboard that can effectively answer any question that I have about my life.

This project is in early development, but you can find some screenshots of how it currently looks below. Because the current implementation is very coupled with my setup and might leak details of how I track my life and personal details.
